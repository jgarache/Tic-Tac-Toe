# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game created with GLUT/OpenGL libraries in C++

# How It Works
The game has two modes: 2 Player mode and A.I. Mode. 2 Player Mode - 2 players are able to play against each other in an intense game of Tic-Tac-Toe. A.I. Mode - You have the opportunity to play against an A.I. that randomly selects an open space on the board. Think you can win?
